      <h1>AUCKLAND</h1>
      <p><span>Our New Zealand adventure started here!</span> We landed on the 19th of November after having spent around 30 hours of travelling. A few days to recover from our jetlag in an AirBnB before heading to our first HelpX placement in the district of Ponsonby (yes, it is as posh as it sounds!). We would spend little over a week here with a young couple renovating an old town hall, to get ourselves established and do some admin (setting up bank accounts etc.) before making a break for Whangerei.</p>

      <h1>WHANGEREI</h1>
      <p><span>After escaping Auckland we</span> arrived in sunny Whangerei. A wonderful couple, David and Henriette (from England and Germany respectively) hosted us for around 10 days and we enjoyed some great work whilst we stayed with them. Also not far from us were Denise and Peter (Brads second cousin) which we were lucky enough to catch up with!</p>

      <p><span>Lego and escaping chickens!</span> After a long drive all the way from Whangerei to Hamilton (check our <a href="#" class="inline-link">route map</a>), we arrived in Ngaruawahia (pronounced <strong>narrow-why-heeya</strong>). An awesome couple - Holly and Rachel hosted us for little over a week. They had several geese and four chickens. The chickens would elude us on a daily basis so we were kept busy on our stay here! We had some great laughs and both would of loved to stay here for longer.</p>

      <h1>MAURICEVILLE</h1>
      <p><span>We could write a whole blog </span> on our time in Mauriceville West! It really was a home away from home. We arrived a week or two before christmas and would not leave until mid January! It was an eclectic mix of tasks and activites during our stay here ranging from weighing calves, fund raising for a local brass band and even becoming part of a sheep shearing gang! Some unforgettable memories and friends made here.</p>

      <h1>WELLINGTON</h1>
      <p><span>A brief stop over in</span> windy Wellington to stay with the family of some of our previous HelpX hosts from Mauriceville. Stu, Rachel and Isabel put us up for a night before we caught a ferry across the Cook straight to the South Island. A few cheeky <a href="http://garageproject.co.nz/collections/beers" class="inline-link"><strong><i>Garage Project</i></strong></a> beers and several games of Dobble were the order of the evening - including possibly the best Thai style fish dinner we have tasted, prepared and cooked from scratch by Rachel. </p>

      <h1>BLENHEIM</h1>
      <p><span>After a slightly bumpy</span> ferry ride, we landed at Picton. Equipped with some old bread rolls and a mother load of slightly sweaty pastrami, we left the ferry port and were off in search of a picnic spot to enjoy our "maturing provisions" and also in search of our friends from the UK, Zoe and Simon, whom were cycle touring around New Zealand with their adorable baby, Billy! After locating both of the aforementioned, we spent most of our time in the campsite at Blenheim or touring around winery "cellar doors"! We would also meet a friend of a friend here too (from Scotland) who would join us on our decadent past times!</p>

      <h1>MARAHAU</h1>
      <p><span>Cicadas and Rachmaninoff would</span> be most of what would hear for the next three weeks in this beautiful part of the south island. At the foot of the Abel Tasman national park, this picture post card location has plenty of outdoor activites to engage in. Kayaking, hiking and kitesurfing to name a few. Our host, Jean-Francois runs an accomodation business where we would help renovate partsof his house and guest houses. 'JF' is also a concert pianist, so would often entertain with the sounds of Rachmaninoff, Bach etc. whist we prepared meals!</p>
